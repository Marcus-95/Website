		Vikings were Norse people primarily from southern Scandinavia (in present-day Denmark, Norway and Sweden), who from the late 8th to late 11th centuries, raided and traded from their Northern European homelands across wide areas of Europe, and explored westwards to Iceland and Greenland. On this website you will be able to learn more about the Vikings and their folklore.

      		<p class="infotext img">A runestone is typically a raised stone with a runic inscription, but the term can also be applied to inscriptions on boulders and on bedrock. The tradition began in the 4th century and lasted into the 12th century, but most of the runestones date from the late Viking Age. Most runestones are located in Scandinavia, but there are also scattered runestones in locations that were visited by Norsemen during the Viking Age. Runestones are often memorials to dead men.
